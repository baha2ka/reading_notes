Records registered through the git remote command are used in conjunction with the git fetch , git push , and git pull commands. by running this command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles. you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

d. git status: to see the changes made & give an explanation about what happened.
